"Let's not talk about bombs and the brain impulses of severed limbs,You will always subtract your arms from my arms,Someone always interrupts us when we talk so I'm gonna draw this evening's line,Before my wash hangs on it for everyone to see,It's very bad luck to draw the line,On the night before the worlds ends,We can draw the line some other time,This midnight I will turn into a beer I will,Dream of you between nightmares and wars and toss and turn,Ain't you gonna take me for a ride drink and drive down to the L.A. river bed,I'll make no mistakes and I'll behave,It's very bad luck to draw the line,On the night before the worlds ends,We can draw the line some other time,Let's not talk about bombs and the brain impulses of severed limbs,You will always subtract your arms from my arms,Someone always interrupts us when we talk so I'm gonna draw this evening's line,Before my wash hangs on it for everyone to see,It's very bad luck to draw the line,On the night before the worlds ends,We can draw the line some other time",Some Other Time,X

"My friend from above,Between those clouds,We stand and watch,Our mind is greeting us,Bubbles of a clear day,And the green plateu of anger,A field, not a rice field,We stand under the leaves of a tree,The river is floating under our feet,The birds chirp and the butterflies,Are searching,No clouds in the sky,The face of a friend is written into blue of the sky,Worship of the omnipotent sun (I dream),A dive into the mirage,Straight-angled death,That instigates the air to reduce,The stench of my heart dies,I bury it in my selfishness,The pain of not knowing - a tense waiting,A raging fear - when the truth is near,Who is a friend? The question of my life,Under the leaven tree - we wait for the answer",Written Into the Sky,Xysma

Hennessy for everyone music proudly presents,Xzibit, movin at the speed of life,Yeah! check it,Verse One:,It took a long time comin but we waited,Xzibit went from underated,To now most anticipaded,never would of thought that I would rock your set,And get love and respect without no special effects,Only the rugged ruff shit that the hard rock need,Lyrics must contain more then just clothes bitches and weed,thinkin' how you like to see the next man bleed,Tryin to glority greed,Livin life at ridiculuos speed,indeed, The main goal to achieve, is to succeed,Have it laid out for your seed,But the world gets colder every day by day,Physically, mentally gettin drained by L.A.,Trying to find piece of mind,is like trying to find a gold mine,it just wont happen,no time for relaxin,Real soldiers of fortune,the front line of the action,So never show a nigga what you packin',""You know what i'm sayin'?"",It's too much weight to be juggling,who do you picture when you think about struggling,Kids in the bed, no food stomach bubblin,Niggas in the E-class heavy drug smugglin,Chorus:,Movin...yeah!,yes movin...,At the speed of life,Verse Two:,And plus I feel that no style is darker than mine,There was a time it was all about beats and rhymes,But nowadays the blind just follow the blind,and when I die,,Niggas still recite these lines,to rock the heads, waterbeds citys and towns,Bringin strength to the masses that be holdin it down,the underground, to upper echelon and beyond,Xzibit rock and roll the streets like a vagabond,Nigga wanna trip you gettin dissed like a blond bitch,Mackin to Farrakhan, I run game like a marathon,It's here today then tomorrow it's gone,It's the law of the land,a straight modern day babylon!,Chorus:,Movin...yeah! yeah! like this,Like this...at the speed of life,Ah! Bring it live, yeah!,Verse Three:,Xzibit lookin at the earth thru wide angles,I found a stairway to heaven in a city of lost angels,Where small situations turn to altercation,with a heavy ass price,'cause niggas don't fight no more,before hip hop was all about drama,anything for a dollar before Kane fucked Madona,Xzibit maintain and stayed bent like a comma,Just me and my bottle,we shall lead not follow,Emcees be full of shit,but they style be hollow,it seems you've bitin off more,than you can possibly swallow,just a day in the life of a man named X,only blunt and latex for the opposite sex,you see niggas comin thru to smoke and pay respect,ever since fifteen, I been ready for anything,whatever they bring in any shape, form or fashion,I live to the fullest and rip rhyme with a passion,but in the mean while if worse comes to worst,bust a round or bust a verse whatever comes first,Yeah,we got it locked down tight,Xzibit bring truth to the light,shit is movin at the speed of life,Chorus:,Movin...,At the speed of life",At the Speed of Life,Xzibit

She disappeared like great Houdini,Against the wall was something sicker than zuccini,I blew her up in bits and bits, her face were gone,MY dick was raw and nibbled to the bone,But she dead, her head was like exploded nigga,A close encounter for the motherfucking bitch killer,[Chorus] (x2),The B the I the T the C the H,The K the I the L the L the A,It's the devil in disguise..,Oh yeah, in disguise,[Verse 3],Cruising down Stocking slow, giving hoes crazy stares,They on their stroll, and half of them I put them there,I saw a bitch, kind of young, Chinese and black mix,I roll my window down, ""Thirty bucks for this trick?"",She approached the Jeep, ""I give you a G if it feels like tight"",She said, ""The way you talking I could suck your dick all night"",Then it was on, I took her home, that was like her first mistake,Cause what the ain't gonna give, X-Raided locc gonna take,I took her in my room G,She laid on the bed and said, ""Daddy, come and kill me"",Not knowing that's what I had for that ass and get,Like Rick James I'm fixed to torture this bitch and shit,I laid her on her back with them spreaded,I grabbed my razor blade and pussy lips got shredded,She was bleeding like that time of the month,I cut a hole fat enough to stick my fist up in her cunt,Stunt that life span that dope got sliced,Bleeding like a hemophiliac sucking dried ice,I chopped the bitch to bits and bits, yeah,Another victim of the nigga with the sickness",Bitch Killa,X-Raided
